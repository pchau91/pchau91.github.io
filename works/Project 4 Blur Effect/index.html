                <h3>About SpiderMan on the Playstation 4</h3>
                <p>The game tells a new story about Spider-Man that is not tied to an existing comic book, video game,
                    or film, and covers both the Peter Parker and Spider-Man aspects of the character.

                    Spider-Man was well received upon release. Critics called it one of the best superhero games made,
                    praising its gameplay, particularly the combat and web-swinging mechanics, graphics, narrative,
                    characterization, and design of New York City, though felt it lacked innovation in its open-world
                    design. The game became a commercial success, selling 3.3 million copies in its first three days of
                    release, and broke several sales records.</p>
